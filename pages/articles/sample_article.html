    There is always an argument that extracurricular activities are not so much important in a child’s life.
    
    For development, extra activities are also most important in student’s life.
    
    Students are pressurized during exams and they have performance pressure too of gaining good grades. In such conditions, there is a need for some extra activities. You cannot force a student to just read books and become intelligent.
    
    Extra activities are also important for the overall development of students.
    
    Sometimes when a school offers sports and extra activities parents do not allow their children to participate. Some students also feel that they do not need the activities, all they need is to concentrate on their books in many school teachers have to convince parents to permit their children to participate in activities. Parents feel that extra activities will distract their children from studies.
    
    Co-curricular activities are important just as academics. When a student is made to do academics and co-curricular activities then only a well-rounded development of the student is done
    
    Students have lots of activities to choose from. Cultural activities, sports activities, competitions, house on duties and lot more. Some students are even interested in more than one activities and they do participate in both keeping in mind about their academics.</p>
